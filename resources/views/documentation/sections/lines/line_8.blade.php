            <p>Please remember you have purchased a very affordable theme and you have not paid for a full-time web design agency. Occasionally we will help with small tweaks, but these requests will be put on a lower priority due to their nature. Support is also 100% optional and we provide it for your connivence, so please be patient, polite and respectful.</p>

            <p>Please visit our <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/yourusername"><strong>profile page</strong></a> or ask question <a href="mailto:yourusername@gmail.com">@yourusername</a></p>

            <strong>Support for my items includes:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>* Responding to questions or problems regarding the item and its features</li>
                <li>* Fixing bugs and reported issues</li>
                <li>* Providing updates to ensure compatibility with new software versions</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Item support does not include:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>* Customization and installation services</li>
                <li>* Support for third party software and plug-ins</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Before seeking support, please...</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>* Make sure your question is a valid Theme Issue and not a customization request.</li>
                <li>* Make sure you have read through the documentation and any related video guides before asking support on how to accomplish a task.</li>
                <li>* Make sure to double check the theme FAQs.</li>
                <li>* Try disabling any active plugins to make sure there isn't a conflict with a plugin. And if there is this way you can let us know.</li>
                <li>* If you have customized your theme and now have an issue, back-track to make sure you didn't make a mistake. If you have made changes and can't find the issue, please provide us with your changelog.</li>
                <li>* Almost 80% of the time we find that the solution to people's issues can be solved with a simple "Google Search". You might want to try that before seeking support. You might be able to fix the issue yourself much quicker than we can respond to your request.</li>
                <li>* Make sure to state the name of the theme you are having issues with when requesting support via ThemeForest.</li>
